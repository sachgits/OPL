Project
Online Business Listing
Features
Businesses are listed and they become available on search in a website- the olx way.
Currently only the admin will input business data in the system but in future the customers will have their own portal to manage their listing. 
A customer can subscribed to any of the following packages ranging from free to enterprise ones to have their business listed. The admin will be able to create a package in the admin portal. A package will have the following properties
1.	Name
2.	Price and allowed discounts
3.	Properties
4.	Trial period (30 days,60 days)
When a customer subscribes for a package, their business details will be collected and entered at the admin portal. The business listing will be activated. Initially the listing will be available for one month for free. Before the end of the free month the customer should get a notification for payment incase no payment is received by then. The admin should have the ability to mark a business listing as paid and enter the amount received. Once listed, a customer or admin will have the ability to post under the listing. The posts will be made available in twitter and FB pages of the customers.
